# Machine Learning: Diabetes Type Two Prediction
Creating and selecting a decent machine learning model for diabetes type two prediciotns

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict diabetes outcomes using a medical dataset.

## Overview
The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training. Missing values are handled using median imputation per class, and correlations between variables are analyzed through visualizations.

## Models
Two classification models are trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## Evaluation
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, features are normalized, and model performance is measured using accuracy.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
